I am a second year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology.
My advisor is [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/).
Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin,
where I worked with [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).
My CV is downloadable [here](http://SimiaoZuo.github.io/files/cv_Simiao_Zuo.pdf).

My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing.
In particular, I am interested in analyzing noisy data using tools
such as weak supervision and adversarial training.
I am also interested in point process.
