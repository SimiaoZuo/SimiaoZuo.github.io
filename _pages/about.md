I am a Data Scientist at Microsoft. I received my Ph.D. in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2023, where I was advised by [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/).
Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (with Highest Honors)
and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (with Highest Honors) from The University of Texas at Austin,
where I worked with [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).
My CV is downloadable [here](http://SimiaoZuo.github.io/files/cv_Simiao_Zuo.pdf).

My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing.
In particular, I am interested in developing principled machine learning algorithms using tools such as weak supervision and adversarial training.
I am also interested in point process.
